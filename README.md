This is a repo with my personal and some university IT projects.
It includes basic apps in Flutter and some simple games created using Godot game engine.
I also added my work from a summer internship in 2024. It is the base of a fitness app, that I've developed further as a university project.
Further updates on existing projects and new ones too to come.
