This is a repo with my personal IT projects.
It includes basic apps in Flutter and some games created using Godot engine.
I also added my work from a summer internship in 2024. It is the base of a fitness app, that I've developed further as a university project.
Other university projects aren't yet included, but will be added in the future.
